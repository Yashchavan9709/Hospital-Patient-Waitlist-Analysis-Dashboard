# Hospital-Patient-Waitlist-Analysis-Dashboard
Used hospital patient waitlist data to analyze historical monthly trend of waiting list of inpatient &amp; outpatient categories, to track current status of patient waiting list, and patient waitlist by case type and speciality.

## Objective
The Hospital Patient Waiting List Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of patient wait. It tracks current waiting list status, highlights monthly trends for inpatient and outpatient categories, and delivers detailed insights by specialty and age group. The dashboard includes summary, detailed and enquiry views, featuring metrics like average, median, and total waiting lists for data-driven decision-making.

##  Tech Stack
Key technologies used to build the dashboard:

1. Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
2. Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculating measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
4. Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (Inpatient & Outpatient) by speciality column to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

## Featues/ Highlights

1. Business Problem - The hospital waitlist data contains records of patients across various age groups and specialties. The goal is to analyze monthly patient waitlist trends and time band vs. age group patterns to identify issues and improve hospital service efficiency and patient waitlist management.
       
2. Goal of the dashoard - Hospitals are facing increasing patient waiting times across inpatient, outpatient, and day case categories, making it difficult to manage capacity and ensure timely care. The challenge is to track current waiting list status, identify trends over time, and understand delays by specialty and age group. This dashboard helps decision-makers pinpoint problem areas and take data-driven actions to reduce wait times and improve patient flow efficiency.

## Insights 
1. The patient waitlist count has been increasing steadily by around 3–5% each year.
2. On average, over 200 patients have been waiting for more than 18 months, followed by the 0–3 month category, which also has around 200 patients waiting.
3. The outpatient waitlist is significantly higher than day cases and inpatients over 70% of total patients, indicating that general checkups account for the largest share with over 300 million patients, followed by urine and blood tests.
4. Patients in the 16–64 age group have the highest count across all time bands, followed by those in the 0–15 and 65+ age groups.

## Suggetions 
1. Increase the number of OPDs or doctors for outpatients to manage the waiting count.
2. Recommend partnering with small diagnostic centers and offer referral commissions.
3. Improve scheduling, capacity planning, and resource allocation.
